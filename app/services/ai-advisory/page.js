        AI Strategy & Advisory
      </h1>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
        We help you move from AI exploration to a concrete, prioritised roadmap that fits
        your business model, data realities, and risk appetite. Instead of chasing generic
        use cases, we focus on where AI can actually reduce friction, improve decisioning,
        or unlock new capabilities.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Engagements typically include discovery sessions with stakeholders, assessment of
        current data and system maturity, and a practical view of the architecture and
        operating model you will need to support AI at scale. The output is a set of
        clearly framed initiatives, not a slideware vision that never ships.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        We also support executive and board-level discussions, helping non-technical
        leaders understand the trade-offs, risks, and sequencing involved in AI adoption,
        especially in regulated environments such as financial services.
